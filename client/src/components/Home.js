      <p>Headcount is designed to be a web application for Adventure Games Paintball where players can make a user profile. On the index page there will be a list of upcoming events that a player can sign up to. A player can view the details of an event and join, providing an estimated time that they will be at the field ready to play. 
          On an event page a player will be able to see details such as the hours of the day/event, the snackshot menu, and the weather for the given day.
